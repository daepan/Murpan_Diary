Lexical Analysis Scanning : identify logical pieces fo the description
Syntax Analysis Parsing : Identify how those pieces relate to each other
Semantic analysis: Identify the meaning of the overall structure
IR Genenration: Design one possible structure
IR Optimization: Simplify the intended structure
Genenration: Fabricate the structure
Optimization: Improve the resulting structure

## Lexical Analysis
* Some tokens can have **attributes** that store extra information about the token
* here we store which integer is represented

### Choosing Tokens

### Formal Languages


## Syntax Analysis

## Semantic Analysis

## IR Generation


# Scannig a Source File


## Scannig is Hard
* C++ : Nested template declaration
